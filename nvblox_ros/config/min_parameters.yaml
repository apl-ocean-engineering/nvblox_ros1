# Use this file as a minimum set of example parameters that you'll most likely
# have to modify.

# Whether to use the static occupancy layer for projective integration. If this flag is set to false (default), TSDF integration is used.
use_static_occupancy_layer: false

# Voxel size (in meters) to use for the map.
voxel_size: 0.05

# The name of the TF frame to be used as the global frame.
global_frame: "left"

# Only used if `use_topic_transforms` is set to true. Pose and transform messages will be interpreted as being in this pose frame, and the remaining transform to the sensor frame will be looked up on the TF tree.
pose_frame: "left"

#  If the depth data is originating from Realsense Depth Cameras.
is_realsense_data: false

# Whether to output a mesh for visualization in rviz, to be used with `nvblox_rviz_plugin`.

compute_esdf: true

# Whether to compute the ESDF in 2D (true) or 3D (false).
esdf_2d: false

# Whether to output a distance slice of the ESDF to be used for path planning
# and visualization (even if the computation is 3D, will output a 2D slice
# for viz).

# Whether to integrate color images to color the mesh.
use_color: false

# Whether to integrate depth images.
use_depth: true

# Whether to integrate LiDAR scans.

esdf_update_rate_hz: 2.0

# The rate (in Hz) at which to publish the static occupancy pointcloud.
occupancy_publication_rate_hz: 2.0

# Specifies what rate to poll the color & depth updates at. Will exit as no-op if no new images. Set this higher than you expect images to come in at.
max_poll_rate_hz: 100.0

# How many messages to store in the sensor messages queues (depth, color, lidar) before deleting oldest messages.
maximum_sensor_message_queue_length: 30

# Radius around the `map_clearing_frame_id` outside which we clear the map. Note that values <= 0.0 indicate that no clearing is performed.
